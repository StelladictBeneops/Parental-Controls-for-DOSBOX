Parental Controls for Individual DOS Games via Auto-Launcher
============================================================

Introduction
------------
This batch script allows parents to set time limits on individual DOS games for their children. The script launches the game in DOSBox in fullscreen mode and provides warnings when the time limit is about to expire. After the time limit is up, the game is closed and the batch file icon is hidden.

1. Download and install DOSBox if you have not already done so.
2. Copy the batch script to a folder on your computer.
3. Open the script in a text editor and update the paths to your DOS games and the DOSBox executable file, as needed.
4. Save the changes and close the text editor.

Usage
-----
1. Double-click the batch script to launch the game.
2. The script will run the game in fullscreen mode and display a warning message when the time limit is about to expire.
3. After the time limit is up, the game will be closed and the batch file icon will be hidden.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If the game does not launch or you encounter other issues, check that the paths to the DOS games and DOSBox are correct in the script.
